## Project Documentation: Building a Custom VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, and EC2 Instances Using Terraform

In this project, I used Terraform to design and deploy a complete AWS network environment. Instead of working with the default VPC, I created a fully customized setup that includes public and private subnets, routing, security controls, and EC2 instances distributed across multiple Availability Zones.

## What I implemented
# 1. Setting up Terraform and AWS Provider

First, I configured Terraform so it knows I'm working in AWS and which region I want to deploy things into.
I also used variables so I can easily change things like the AMI, instance type, and number of EC2s later without touching the main code. This makes the configuration flexible and easy to modify.

# 2. Created a Custom VPC

I deployed a custom VPC with the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 and enabled DNS support and hostnames.
This VPC serves as the foundation for all network components.

# 3. Built Public Subnets Across Two AZs

I created two public subnets, each placed in a different Availability Zone (us-east-2a and us-east-2b) for high availability.
Both subnets were configured to automatically assign public IP addresses to instances launched within them.

# 4. Built a Private Subnet
I added a private subnet in us-east-2a.
Instances launched here do not receive public IPs, making it suitable for backend or internal workloads.

# 5. Created an Internet Gateway

To let my public subnets reach the internet, I attached an internet gateway to the VPC.
This is basically the “doorway” between my VPC and the internet.

# 6. Created a Public Route Table

I created a route table and added a route that sends all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the internet gateway.
Then I associated both public subnets with this route table.
This is what officially makes them “public.”

# 7. Built a Security Group for SSH + HTTP

I created one security group that allows:
SSH (port 22)
HTTP (port 80)
All outbound traffic.
This security group is attached to every EC2 I launched, both public and private.
In my setup, the private subnet’s route table does not have a route to an Internet Gateway.
Because of this, any traffic coming from the internet has no path to reach my EC2 instance.
So even if my security group allows ports like 22 or 80, the instance stays protected because the route table prevents any external internet access.

# 8. EC2 Instances in Public Subnets

I deployed two EC2 instances in the public subnets using the count function.
Each instance goes into a different public subnet for resiliency.
By deploying instances across multiple subnets, I added redundancy (multiple instances) which improves the overall resiliency of my setup.
By spreading instances across different subnets and AZs:

If one Availability Zone goes down
- The other instance in the other AZ is still running.

If one subnet has issues
- The other subnet still works.

This increases high availability and reduces downtime.

# 8. EC2 Instance in Private Subnet

I deployed an additional EC2 instance into the private subnet.
This instance does not get a public IP and can only be accessed from inside the VPC (for example, through a bastion host or via Systems Manager).

This simulates a backend server such as a database or internal service.

# 9. Added Output Values

To help verify and reference the environment, I added outputs for:

The VPC ID
Public IP addresses of the public EC2 instances
The Availability Zones where the public instances were deployed
These outputs make validation straightforward after running terraform apply.

# 10. Final verification from my AWS concole
By the end of the project, I had:

A fully custom VPC
Two public subnets in different AZs
One private subnet
An internet gateway and routing
A security group
Public EC2 instances
A private EC2 instance
Useful Terraform outputs

Everything was automated through Terraform, which makes it easy to destroy and rebuild anytime with a single command.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I created a production-style AWS network architecture using Terraform and strengthened my skills in VPC design, subnet layout, routing configuration, security groups, and automated EC2 provisioning. It also allowed me to apply best practices for building, secure and scalable cloud environments.
